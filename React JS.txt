Lifecycle of Components
	Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.
	The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

Mounting
	Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.
	React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

		constructor()
		getDerivedStateFromProps()
		render()
		componentDidMount()

	The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.

	getDerivedStateFromProps
		The getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM.
		This is the natural place to set the state object based on the initial props.
		It takes state as an argument, and returns an object with changes to the state.

	componentDidMount
		The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered.
		This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM.
